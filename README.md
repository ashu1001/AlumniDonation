# AlumniDonation

Alumni donations are an important source of revenue for colleges and universities. If administrators could determine the factors that influence 
increases in the percentage of alumni who make a donation, they might be able to implement policies that could lead to increased revenues. Research 
shows that students who are more satisfied with their contact with teachers are more likely to graduate. As a result, one might suspect that smaller 
class sizes and lower student-faculty ratios might lead to a higher percentage of satisfied graduates, which in turn might lead to increases in the 
percentage of alumni who make a donation. The attached data alumni.xls shows data for 48 national universities (Americaâ€™s Best Colleges, Year 2000 Edition). 
The column labeled % of Classes Under 20 shows the percentage of classes offered with fewer than 20 students. The column labeled Student/Faculty Ratio is 
the number of students enrolled divided by the total number of faculty. Finally, the column labeled Alumni Giving Rate is the percentage of alumni that made
 a donation to the university.
